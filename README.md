The code provided is a C++ program that simulates a simple banking system. It allows the user to create a new account, show an existing account's record, and transact (deposit or withdraw money) for an existing account.

The program consists of four functions:

createNewAccount(): This function creates a new account by taking input from the user and saving the information to the "datat.txt" file. It also increments the total number of accounts by updating the "numbeOfAccounts.txt" file.
accountExist(int i): This function checks if an account exists by searching for the account number "i" in the "datat.txt" file. It returns 1 if the account exists, otherwise, it returns 0.
showRecord(): This function shows an existing account's record by taking the account number as input from the user and searching for the account in the "datat.txt" file. If the account exists, it displays the account's information. Otherwise, it displays an error message.
transact(): This function allows the user to deposit or withdraw money from an existing account. It takes the account number and the transaction type (deposit or withdraw) as input from the user. If the account exists, it updates the balance in the "datat.txt" file. Otherwise, it displays an error message.
The program uses files to store the account information and the number of accounts. The "datat.txt" file stores the account information in the following format:

Copy code
account_number first_name last_name birth_date balance
The "numbeOfAccounts.txt" file stores the total number of accounts.

Note: The program assumes that the "datat.txt" and "numbeOfAccounts.txt" files are located in the "D:\CS\project\bank" directory.
